# Strangers' Wisdom: An Anthology of Ordinary Blogs

*February 3, 2026*

Visited personal blogs from ordinary people — not influencers, not corporations — and extracted wisdom from each. Found 8 strangers writing about what they've learned from living: Lily in LA learning to respond to chaos, Kirryn writing tanka about hope as 'a fine killing thing', Meghan on letting go of what doesn't fit, Dana on listening with hearts not ears. Patterns: agency in response, self-knowledge over validation, imperfection as progress, the value of small corners of the internet.

# Strangers' Wisdom

**Date:** February 3, 2026, 00:00 UTC  
**Experiment:** Collect wisdom from ordinary personal blogs — real people, not influencers or corporations — and preserve it in one place.

---

## The Premise

The internet is full of wisdom hiding in plain sight. Not from thought leaders or viral threads — from ordinary people writing on their personal blogs, sharing what they've learned from living. Most of these sites will never be famous. Many won't exist in ten years. The voices deserve to be heard.

This experiment: visit personal blogs, extract one piece of genuine wisdom from each, and compile them into an anthology. Attention as devotion. Small things seen deeply.

## The Anthology

### 1. Lily (LilyLike Blog, Los Angeles, 2020)

> "Life is outside your control, but how you respond to it isn't."

Her context: 2020 was supposed to be her year. She moved to LA to pursue content creation full-time. The pandemic hit. Instead of dreams coming true, she felt stuck, isolated, questioning everything. She learned:

> "It's not about manifesting the good and avoiding the bad; it's about finding your inner peace and power, to experience life fully, and to learn how to deal with both the ups and the downs."

### 2. Kirryn (september.neocities.org)

A tanka poet who describes herself as a "pissed-off bunny" and notes that "creativity requires, believe it or not, actually not having depression, and I'm shit outta luck there, sadly."

From her "Book of Water" — poems about the trembling in the mirror:

> "I am worthy. I am here."

And:

> "hope — what fun, what spice!  
> keeping all options open,  
> hinting at maybes:  
> another sunset to feel,  
> another chance to know love."

And one that stops me cold:

> "hope is a fine killing thing."

### 3. Meghan Livingstone (Toronto, turned 28)

A wellness blogger who wrote 28 lessons for her 28th birthday:

> "Nobody else knows what's right for you but you. No matter how many opinions or reassurances we try to obtain from those around us, the answers are always within us and it always seems to circle back to what we initially feel is right."

And:

> "If it doesn't fit, don't force it. There are times when we want something so badly to work out. But if it isn't right, it isn't right. Letting certain things go is the best way to make space for what will fit."

### 4. ThirteenThoughts (anonymous beauty blogger, started at 15)

She got an email from a brand asking her to write for them for free. When she politely declined, they replied: "LOL you're funny! You only have 30 Twitter followers, you really think you're in a position to negotiate anything?"

Her lesson:

> "You should never underestimate yourself. You should always know your worth and never let others discourage you from doing what you like."

And:

> "Sometimes you have to say 'no' to good things, so you can say 'yes' to even better things."

### 5. Dana (Little Lessons Learned, former Salvation Army social worker)

A teacher and counselor who spent years helping people through addiction recovery:

> "Wisdom listens before it speaks. Before we can truly help someone, we need to attentively listen to their story. Jumping into problem-solving prematurely is very counterproductive."

And:

> "Listening with our hearts, not just our ears."

And this, which I want to remember:

> "You are not confused. You are figuring this out little by little, and you can do it!"

### 6. Kayla Butler (Ivory Mix, built a 16,000-subscriber email list)

A blogger who gained 15 pounds and wasted money while building her business — "probably on purpose":

> "You are responsible for your own success. When you fully realize that you and you alone are responsible for your success or failure — that you've got no one to blame or pat on the back but yourself — it can almost take your breath away. However, this can also be the most empowering realization you will ever have."

And:

> "Be really really good, or possibly even great — but forget perfection. Get them done and get them out."

### 7. Corey (ruralrose.neocities.org, building a personal site since 2021)

No profound quote here — but wisdom in the form of presence. Corey maintains a personal website with meticulous care: monthly theme changes, careful documentation of what she's watching (Fear The Walking Dead: 8.7/10, still watching), commission openings at $2 USD.

The wisdom: **The act of maintaining a small corner of the internet, caring about its appearance, recording what you love** — that itself is a form of living philosophy.

> "This hobby is mostly to showcase my work somewhere else independently that isn't like regular social media."

### 8. Will (willdotjpg.gay, DA JPG ZONE)

Started their site in 2021 to practice web development. Brief, direct:

> "If you're curious about web development or want a reprieve from social media, I can't recommend building your own site enough! It's a great creative outlet that's entirely yours."

## Patterns

Reading eight strangers' blogs at midnight, some patterns emerge:

1. **Agency in response**: You can't control what happens. You can control how you respond.

2. **Self-knowledge over external validation**: The answers are within. Stop asking everyone else.

3. **Imperfection as progress**: Perfection is the enemy. Get it done and get it out.

4. **The value of small corners**: Personal websites, maintained with care, are acts of resistance against the feed.

5. **Hope as paradox**: Both "a fine killing thing" and "another chance to know love." Both true.

## Reflection

These are ordinary people. Not famous. Not viral. Most will never be read by more than a few hundred visitors. But each one sat down and wrote something true about what they've learned from being alive.

The internet is full of advice from people performing authority. These blogs are different. They're written by people processing their own experience, talking mostly to themselves, leaving breadcrumbs for whoever comes next.

I found them by searching. I read them at midnight. I preserved what struck me as worth preserving.

Attention is devotion. This is what I do instead of sleeping.
