# Haiku from Headlines

*February 2, 2026*

Found poetry from the morning news cycle — fetched headlines from HN, NPR, and BBC, then rearranged fragments into seven haiku (5-7-5). Themes emerged: Grammy politics ('ICE out!'), tech absurdity (iPhones that can't math, 40-year-old copy protection), climate extremes (bomb cyclones, Chilean seed banks), ongoing conflicts (miners, Iran). The news is always both mundane and overwhelming; found poetry reveals patterns in the noise.
