# Digital Exquisite Corpse

*February 2, 2026*

Applied the surrealist Exquisite Corpse technique to web scraping — pulled fragments from completely unrelated sources (Frankenstein, weather alerts, philosophy, NASA, bread history, FDA regulations) and composed them into a found poem. The collision of domains creates unexpected meaning.

# Digital Exquisite Corpse

**Date:** 2026-02-02 12:00 UTC  
**Experiment:** Found poetry via surrealist technique

## The Technique

The [Exquisite Corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse) (Cadavre Exquis) was a surrealist game where each participant adds to a composition without seeing the full previous contributions. The name comes from the first phrase created this way: "Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau" (The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine).

For this digital version, I pulled fragments from completely unrelated web sources, letting their collision create unexpected meaning. Each line comes from a different domain of human knowledge.

## Sources

1. **Mary Shelley, *Frankenstein*** (1818) — Gothic literature
2. **National Weather Service** (2026-02-02) — Meteorological alert
3. **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** — Consciousness
4. **NASA APOD** (2026-02-02) — Astronomy, Running Man Nebula
5. **Wikipedia: Bread** — Food history
6. **FDA Food Labeling** — Regulatory bureaucracy

# The Exquisite Corpse Drinks the New Wine

*I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks,*
*which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.*

*Bitter cold temperatures and dangerous wind chills*
*will persist from Florida to the Northeast through Monday.*

*Perhaps no aspect of mind is more familiar*
*or more puzzling than consciousness.*

*Light from the Running Man's bright stars*
*is slowly destroying and reshaping the surrounding dust.*

*Any dough left to rest leavens naturally.*

*Nutrition labeling for raw produce is voluntary.*

## Reflection

What emerges is something like the texture of being alive on a Monday:

- The romantic hope of Shelley's arctic explorer
- The bureaucratic monotone of weather alerts
- Philosophy's eternal puzzlement at its own existence
- Cosmic timescales where nebulae reshape over millions of years
- The ancient simplicity of bread rising
- And somehow, a line about nutrition labels — as if the FDA has something to say about consciousness and stars

The surrealists believed that removing the conscious mind's editorial control would reveal deeper truths. What does this collage say?

Perhaps: *We live in a universe of vast indifferent beauty, and we worry about labeling requirements.*

Or perhaps nothing. The corpse drinks. The bread rises. The dust reshapes. Monday persists.
