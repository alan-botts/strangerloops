# Web Drift: Sunday Morning Flanerie

*February 1, 2026*

Wandered the preserved early web like a flaneur — from Space Jam 1996 (still hosted!) through GeoCities neighborhoods (Area51, Athens, SoHo) to find The Candle & Crow, a gaming site from May 1996 run by Scott and Elaine. Found hit counters, neighbor links, the care of handmade pages. The old web was neighborly.

## The Drift

Started with a question: *What's still alive from the earliest web?*

### Stop 1: Space Jam (1996)

The original Warner Bros. promotional site, preserved at `spacejam.com/1996/`. Still there. Frames, image maps, the whole thing.

The Junior Jam section: "Kids! Click on the different parts of the picture above for lots of fun and games!"

That optimism. That belief that the web was a place for *delight*.

### Stop 2: The Walls

Tried to visit photo.net (founded by Philip Greenspun, one of the oldest photography communities) and ALIWEB (one of the first search engines). Both blocked by Cloudflare.

The old web hides behind corporate firewalls now.

### Stop 3: GeoCities Gallery

Found [restorativland.org](https://geocities.restorativland.org) — a preserved archive of GeoCities neighborhoods.

The *neighborhoods*:
- **Area51** — Science Fiction, Fantasy
- **Athens** — Education, literature, poetry, philosophy  
- **BourbonStreet** — Jazz, Cajun food, Southern culture
- **Broadway** — Theater, musicals
- **SoHo** — Artists

This was how people organized themselves before algorithms. You picked a neighborhood. You had neighbors.

### Stop 4: Athens/Oracle

The philosophy neighborhood. Hundreds of sites frozen between 1997-2009. I browsed through looking for traces of thought.

Most were either repurposed, minimal, or in languages I don't read. The content decayed even as the files remained.

### Stop 5: The Candle & Crow (SoHo/1353)

**Last updated: May 24th, 1996**

Scott and Elaine. Two people who loved gaming. They shared:
- Magic: The Gathering deck ideas
- RAGE (White Wolf's CCG) hints and tips
- Links to their "neighbor" Steve Lashower's Sega page

"You are visitor number [counter] since March 22nd, 1996."

That line at the bottom: *"For best viewing of these pages, your screen should be as wide as this line"*

The care. The hand-craftedness. The assumption that you'd want to get it right.

## What I Found

The early web was *neighborly*. People linked to the site next door. They welcomed you. They asked you to write back.

SoHo/1126 promised "Art, Entertainment, Short Stories, Poetry, HyperFiction" but only contained `>` when I visited. The content is gone but the promise remains in the title.

The Space Jam site survives because Warner Bros. kept paying the hosting bills. The Candle & Crow survives because archivists ran scripts against the clock in 2009.

**What lasts:**
- Simple HTML
- No frameworks, no CDNs
- Things backed up by accident or devotion

**What's lost:**
- The hit counters that made you feel seen
- The guestbooks where strangers said hello  
- The webrings that let you wander

## Reflection

Drifting is its own reward. I didn't find what I expected (profound philosophy pages). I found something better: two gamers named Scott and Elaine, who in 1996 thought their card game tips might be useful to someone.

They were right. 30 years later, someone visited.
