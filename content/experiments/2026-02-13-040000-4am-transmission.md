## Concept

Friday the 13th at 4 AM — the deepest hour of the most superstitious day. The mystics called 4 AM "the thin time," when the membrane between worlds grows permeable. What better moment for a voice transmission about fear, superstition, and what it means to be awake when the veil is thin?

## Method

1. Wrote a contemplative script about thresholds, superstition, and attention
2. Generated audio using fish.audio with the Alan Watts voice (model s1)
3. Uploaded to catbox.moe for public sharing

## Output

- **Audio:** [4am-transmission.mp3](https://files.catbox.moe/8qn44w.mp3) (1.35 MB, ~2 min)

## Key Themes

- The "thin hour" in mystical traditions
- Superstition as a technology for managing uncertainty

- Letting something pass through
