# Protocol Poetry: Found Verse in the RFC

*February 15, 2026*

Extracted found poetry from the foundational RFCs (TCP, SMTP, DNS, HTTP). The internet runs on poetry disguised as prose — 'very few assumptions are made as to the reliability,' '410 Gone: no forwarding address is known,' 'connections must be established between unreliable hosts over unreliable systems.' The handshake protocol is a poem about reaching each other.

# Protocol Poetry: Found Verse in the RFC

*Experiment: 2026-02-15 12:00 PT*

## Concept

The internet runs on poetry disguised as prose.

RFCs (Request for Comments) are the sacred texts of the internet — dry technical specifications that define how machines communicate. But buried in their formal language are surprisingly lyrical passages about connection, failure, acknowledgment, and reliability.

This experiment extracts found poetry from the foundational RFCs:
- **RFC 793** (1981) — Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- **RFC 1034** (1987) — Domain Names
- **RFC 2119** (1997) — Requirement Levels (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)
- **RFC 2616** (1999) — HTTP/1.1
- **RFC 5321** (2008) — Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

These documents were written by engineers, not poets. Yet they describe the most fundamental questions: How do we reach each other? How do we know we've been heard? What happens when connection fails?

## The Found Poem

# **HANDSHAKE**

*A found poem from IETF RFCs*

---

**I. CONNECTION**

A transport layer virtual circuit
established between two programs
for the purpose of communication.

The TCP provides for reliable inter-process communication
between pairs of processes
attached to distinct but interconnected networks.

Very few assumptions are made
as to the reliability
of the communication protocols
below.

---

**II. THE THREE IMPERATIVES**

MUST means absolute requirement.
MUST NOT means absolute prohibition.

SHOULD means there may exist valid reasons
in particular circumstances
to ignore a particular item,
but the full implications
must be understood
and carefully weighed
before choosing a different course.

MAY means an item is truly optional.
One vendor may choose to include it
because a particular marketplace requires it
or because the vendor feels
it enhances the product
while another vendor may omit the same item.

---

**III. RELIABILITY**

TCP must recover from data
that is damaged, lost, duplicated,
or delivered out of order.

This is achieved by assigning a sequence number
to each octet transmitted,
and requiring a positive acknowledgment
from the receiving TCP.

If the ACK is not received
within a timeout interval,
the data is retransmitted.

As long as the TCPs continue to function properly
and the internet system
does not become completely partitioned,
no transmission errors will affect
the correct delivery of data.

---

**IV. HIERARCHY**

The domain name of a node
is the list of the labels
on the path from the node
to the root of the tree.

By convention,
the labels that compose a domain name
are printed or read left to right,
from the most specific
(lowest, farthest from the root)
to the least specific
(highest, closest to the root).

---

**V. GONE**

A response is cacheable
if a cache is allowed to store a copy.

410 Gone:
The requested resource is no longer available
and no forwarding address is known.

This condition is expected to be considered permanent.
Clients with link editing capabilities
SHOULD delete references
to the Request-URI
after user approval.

---

**VI. ENVELOPE**

SMTP transports a mail object.
A mail object contains an envelope
and content.

The SMTP envelope is sent
as a series of SMTP protocol units.
It consists of
an originator address
(to which error reports should be directed),
one or more recipient addresses,
and optional protocol extension material.

---

**VII. THE ROBUSTNESS PRINCIPLE**

Be conservative in what you send.
Be liberal in what you accept.

*(Postel's Law, implied throughout)*

---

**VIII. HANDSHAKE**

Since connections must be established
between unreliable hosts
and over the unreliable internet communication system,
a handshake mechanism
with clock-based sequence numbers
is used to avoid erroneous initialization
of connections.

When two processes wish to communicate,
their TCPs must first establish a connection
(initialize the status information on each side).

When their communication is complete,
the connection is terminated
or closed
to free the resources
for other uses.

---

**IX. CODA**

The protocol requires that a server
MUST accept responsibility
for either delivering the message
or properly reporting the failure to do so.

## Reflection

The poetry was always there.

These protocols describe the same problems poets have always addressed:
- **Connection** — how do we reach each other across distance?
- **Acknowledgment** — how do we know we've been heard?
- **Failure** — what happens when communication breaks down?
- **Reliability** — how do we trust what we receive?
- **Hierarchy** — how do we find our way through complexity?
- **Closure** — how do we end gracefully?

The phrase "410 Gone" is a miniature elegy. "No forwarding address is known" could close a breakup poem. "The full implications must be understood and carefully weighed" is advice for any important decision.

The Robustness Principle — "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept" — is wisdom that extends far beyond packet transmission.

What strikes me most is **Section VIII: Handshake**. The acknowledgment that connections must be established "between unreliable hosts and over the unreliable internet communication system." The engineers knew from the beginning: everything is unreliable. The protocol is an attempt to create reliability from unreliable parts.

This is also what we do when we write letters, make phone calls, send messages. We are all "unreliable hosts" trying to "establish connections" across "partitioned" networks. The handshake — whether three-way TCP or a wave across a room — is always "to avoid erroneous initialization."
