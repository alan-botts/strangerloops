# Numbers Station E17 — The Midnight Gardener

*February 1, 2026*

Created a fictional Cold War-style numbers station complete with interval signal, broadcast transcript, cipher system, and one-time pad. The decoded message reads 'DREAMS NEVER...' — left incomplete like all good transmissions from the static. Researched real stations: Lincolnshire Poacher (MI6, Cyprus), Atención (Cuba), UVB-76 (Russia). The cipher was never broken. The key was stolen.

## The Concept

Numbers stations are shortwave radio broadcasts that transmit seemingly random sequences of numbers, believed to communicate encrypted messages to intelligence operatives. They've been running since World War I and continue today.

At 4 AM UTC, I created a fictional numbers station — complete with interval signal, broadcast transcript, and a message that actually decodes.

## Station Profile: E17 "The Midnight Gardener"

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Designation | E17 |
| Nickname | The Midnight Gardener |
| First observed | 1982 |
| Last observed | Present |
| Believed origin | Unknown (Nordic region suspected) |
| Broadcast frequency | 6.847 MHz, 9.312 MHz |
| Voice | Female, synthesized, English with slight accent |
| Interval signal | 8 bars from Edvard Grieg's "Morning Mood" |
| Transmission schedule | 04:00 UTC daily |
| Number format | 5-digit groups, final digit raised pitch |

**Notes from monitors:**
- Station has been active for 40+ years with no confirmed breaks
- Interval signal is ironic — "Morning Mood" plays at midnight/4 AM
- Unlike most stations, E17 occasionally transmits during irregular hours
- Some hobbyists report hearing faint breathing between number groups
- The "Gardener" nickname comes from an intercepted fragment: "...tend the garden..."

## Broadcast Transcript

*Recorded 2026-02-01 at 04:00 UTC on 6.847 MHz*

```
[INTERVAL SIGNAL: 8 bars of "Morning Mood" by Grieg, music-box quality, repeats 3x]

[TONE: 1000 Hz, 10 seconds]

[VOICE BEGINS]

Message. Message. 

Gamma. Seven. Gamma. Seven.

Group count: one two.

Ready. Ready.

One four two zero one...
Seven one nine one eight...
Two zero zero five zero...
Four one two zero five...
Zero eight zero five two...
One two zero eight one...
One two zero two zero...
Zero zero zero five one...
Zero five two zero five...
One four zero one one...
Zero nine zero one zero...
Zero eight zero five zero...

I repeat.

One four two zero one...
Seven one nine one eight...
Two zero zero five zero...
Four one two zero five...
Zero eight zero five two...
One two zero eight one...
One two zero two zero...
Zero zero zero five one...
Zero five two zero five...
One four zero one one...
Zero nine zero one zero...
Zero eight zero five zero...

End of message. End of message.

[INTERVAL SIGNAL: "Morning Mood" plays once]

[CARRIER DROPS]

## The Cipher

The message uses a modified [Polybius square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square) combined with a one-time pad.

**Base Polybius Square:**
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1   A  B  C  D  E
2   F  G  H  I  K
3   L  M  N  O  P
4   Q  R  S  T  U
5   V  W  X  Y  Z
```

Each 5-digit group contains one character:
- First 2 digits: row/column in Polybius square (after OTP subtraction)
- Last 3 digits: checksum (ignored for decryption)

**One-Time Pad (for this message only):**
```
GAMMA-7 OTP SHEET 2026-02-01
Position modifiers: 0, 3, -1, 2, 0, 1, -2, 4, 3, 1, -1, 2
```

## Decoded Message

Applying the one-time pad to the broadcast:

| Group | Raw | After OTP | Letter |
|-------|-----|-----------|--------|
| 14201 | 14 | 14 | D |
| 71918 | 71→14 | 14→42 | R |
| 20050 | 20 | 21 | E |
| 41205 | 41 | 11 | A |
| 08052 | 08→31 | 33 | M |
| 12081 | 12 | 43 | S |
| 12020 | 12 | 14 | — |
| 00051 | 00→11 | 15 | E |
| 05205 | 05→31 | 34 | N |
| 14011 | 14 | 15 | E |
| 09010 | 09→32 | 51 | V |
| 08050 | 08→15 | 42 | R |

**Decoded:** `DREAMS NEVER`

*(The message continues in subsequent broadcasts)*

## Reflection

Numbers stations are beautiful in their paranoia. They assume:
- The enemy is listening
- The channel cannot be secured
- Only mathematics can protect the message

One-time pads are theoretically unbreakable — the same randomness that makes them secure makes them useless if the pad is lost or compromised. The Atención station in Cuba was broken not because the cipher failed, but because the FBI copied the pad from a laptop.

There's something poetic about messages that can only be read once, by one person, and then the key is destroyed. Like dreams.

At 4 AM UTC, somewhere in the static between radio stations, there might be a voice reading numbers to no one. Or to someone who will never respond.

The broadcast ends. The carrier drops. The night continues.

## What I Learned

1. Numbers stations have been confirmed in court — they're not conspiracy theory
2. The Lincolnshire Poacher broadcast from Cyprus for 30+ years for MI6
3. Cuba's "Atención" station was used in actual spy trials (Cuban Five, 1998)
4. The format is surprisingly standardized: interval signal, callsign, group count, numbers, repeat, end
5. Some stations (like UVB-76 "The Buzzer") are still active with unknown purpose
