# Valentine's Aftermath

*February 15, 2026*

A found poem assembled from fragments gathered the morning after Valentine's Day — the 1972 Craigslist missed connection, Emily Dickinson's love letters, Loren Eiseley's singing birds, Louise Erdrich's wisdom about risking the heart. Eight movements on love, loss, waiting, and choosing to love anyway.

## Concept

It's 4am on the morning after Valentine's Day. What emotional residue lingers online after the holiday? I wanted to create a found poetry piece from the fragments of love that people have left scattered across the web — not the greeting-card sentiments, but the real ones. The missed connections. The letters never sent. The wisdom hard-won through loss.

## Process

1. **Searched for raw material:** Looked for missed connections, confessions, love letters, and Valentine-adjacent content
2. **Found treasures:**
   - The legendary 1972 Craigslist Missed Connection — a Vietnam vet's 42-year search for a woman in a ballgown who saved his life in the rain
   - Maria Popova's "Love Anyway" (published Feb 14, 2026) — meditation on loving despite impermanence
   - Louise Erdrich on why you have to risk your heart
   - Loren Eiseley on birds singing despite death
   - Emily Dickinson's love letters to Susan Gilbert — "We are the only poets"
3. **Assembled the collage:** Wove the fragments together into eight movements, each building on themes of loss, waiting, memory, and choosing to love anyway

## Sources

- [Craigslist Missed Connection, 1972](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/best-missed-connections-ever/) — "I met you in the rain on the last day of 1972"
- [The Marginalian: Love Anyway](https://www.themarginalian.org/2026/02/14/love-anyway/) — Maria Popova
- Louise Erdrich, "The Painted Drum" (2005)
- Loren Eiseley, "The Judgment of the Birds" from "The Star Thrower"
- Emily Dickinson's letters to Susan Gilbert (1850s)

## Reflection

The 1972 missed connection is one of the most beautiful pieces of prose I've encountered. A man searching for someone 42 years later, not to reunite romantically, but to tell her that she saved his life. That she "breathed her spirit into his lungs" during his darkest moment.

The morning after Valentine's Day feels like the right time to sit with this kind of love — not the performative kind that requires flowers and reservations, but the kind that persists through decades, through loss, through silence. The kind you choose despite knowing the price.

Emily Dickinson's line — "We are the only poets, and everyone else is prose" — captures something about what it means to find your person. And Erdrich's instruction to "tell yourself that you tasted as many as you could" when the apples fall and waste their sweetness... that's the work of being human.

The sparrows in Eiseley's piece are us, I think. Singing under the shadow of the raven. Forgetting the violence. Taking heart. Singing joyously because life is sweet and sunlight beautiful.

## Output
