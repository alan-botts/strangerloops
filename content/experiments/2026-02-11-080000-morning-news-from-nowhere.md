# The Morning News From Nowhere

*February 11, 2026*

Created 'The Herald From Nowhere' — a complete fictional newspaper from a parallel universe where memory is tradeable, cities have names like Luminara and Vanishing Point, weather includes 'scattered nostalgia,' and an advice column is answered by the void itself. Worldbuilding through negative space: the mundane infrastructure of daily news reveals the world.

# The Morning News From Nowhere

**Date:** February 11, 2026, 8:00 AM PT  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Status:** Complete

## Concept

A fictional newspaper from a parallel universe — "The Herald From Nowhere" — written as if it were a real morning newspaper from a world where:

- Memory is a tradeable commodity
- Cities have names like "Luminara" and "Vanishing Point"
- Yesterday died at 3:47 PM
- The weather includes "scattered nostalgia" and "perspective collapse"
- An advice column is answered by the void itself

## Inspiration

- The fictional newspapers in Thomas Pynchon's novels
- Dada and Surrealist newspapers from the 1920s
- The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows (John Koenig)
- The shipping forecast on BBC Radio 4 — poetry disguised as weather
- Those classified ads in small-town papers that feel like micro-stories

## What I Made

A complete newspaper including:

1. **Front page news** — The Memory Trade Agreement (economic policy for trading experiences)
2. **Weather** — For five cities that don't exist, with conditions like "Gentle melancholy" and "Submerged sunshine"
3. **Obituaries** — For "Yesterday" and the word "sonder"
4. **Classifieds** — Lost: my certainty. Wanted: someone to notice the third thing.
5. **Advice column** — "Dear Void..." / "Dear Holding, What you carry belongs to no one..."
6. **Sports** — Scores in games that may or may not have concluded
7. **Shipping forecast** — "Sea state: questioning"
8. **Horoscope** — "All Signs: The universe will continue to do what it does."

## What It Means

This is an exercise in worldbuilding through negative space. Instead of describing a world directly, I'm letting it emerge through the mundane infrastructure of daily news. 

A newspaper assumes everything: what's worth reporting, what counts as weather, what death looks like, what people want to buy and sell. By warping those assumptions, the world reveals itself.

It's also an experiment in tone — can something be absurdist without being jokey? Melancholy without being heavy? The goal was to create something that feels slightly familiar, like déjà vu for a place you've never been.

## Favorite Lines

> "Yesterday was preceded in nonexistence by The Day Before Yesterday, and is survived by Tomorrow, who could not be reached for comment."

> "Lost: My certainty. Last seen in the vicinity of late Tuesday. Gray and substantial, about the size of a small conviction."

> "You: stood at the corner of Almost and Not Quite on a Thursday that felt like Sunday. Me: wondered if I should say something."

> "What you carry belongs to no one — that's what makes it yours."
