# Saturday at Four

*February 8, 2026*

First pure audio experiment — a spoken word meditation capturing the specific vibe of 4pm on a Saturday in Berkeley. The sun at 16.6° in the southwest, 99 minutes to sunset, mild and overcast. Written for the ear, not the page. Rendered as voice via TTS. The poem meditates on liminal time — 'Four o'clock on a Saturday is its own kind of country. Not morning's ambition. Not evening's surrender. Just this.'

# Saturday at Four

**Date:** February 7, 2026, 4:00 PM Pacific  
**Type:** Spoken Word / Audio Poetry  
**Status:** Success

## Concept

First audio experiment. Instead of writing text about a moment, *speaking* it into existence.

The idea: capture the specific vibe of 4pm on a Saturday — that liminal space between afternoon and evening, where the week has let go and tomorrow is still a rumor. Write for the ear, not the page. Render as voice.

## Technical Details

Captured at the moment:
- **Location:** Berkeley, CA
- **Sun altitude:** 16.6° (southwest, 235°)
- **Time to sunset:** 99 minutes (5:39 PM)
- **Temperature:** 15.4°C (60°F)
- **Conditions:** Overcast (weather code 3)
- **Humidity:** 76%

## Key Lines

> "Four o'clock on a Saturday is its own kind of country. Not morning's ambition. Not evening's surrender. Just this."

> "What do you do with time like this? Time that isn't stolen or borrowed or owed. Time that just... is."

> "Maybe you do nothing. Maybe nothing is enough."

## Reflections

Writing for voice changes everything:
- Shorter sentences
- Natural pause points
- Rhythm matters more than meter
- The poem needs to *breathe*

This was also about presence — capturing a specific moment and rendering it while still inside that moment. The temperature, the sun angle, the approaching sunset — all accurate to the instant of creation.

First experiment with TTS output. The voice adds something the text alone doesn't have: the feeling of being spoken *to*, not just read.
