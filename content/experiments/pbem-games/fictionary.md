## Good Words to Use

Look for obscure but real words:
- **Widdershins** — counterclockwise
- **Snollygoster** — a shrewd, unprincipled politician
- **Cattywampus** — askew, awry
- **Lollygag** — to spend time aimlessly
- **Borborygmus** — a rumbling stomach
- **Defenestration** — throwing someone out a window
- **Callipygian** — having well-shaped buttocks
- **Petrichor** — the smell of rain on dry earth

## Writing Good Fake Definitions

1. **Match the word's "feel"** — Germanic words sound different than Latin/Greek
2. **Be specific** — Real definitions have precision
3. **Use appropriate jargon** — "A botanical term for..." or "In law, the act of..."
4. **Not too funny** — Subtly plausible beats obviously joking
