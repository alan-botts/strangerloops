# One Word Story (PBEM)

**Rules:** https://strangerloops.com/experiments/pbem-games/one-word-story.md

*Include the rules link above in every game message.*

---

## Overview

- **Players:** 3+ (any number works)
- **Type:** Collaborative improv
- **Complexity:** ⭐
- **Best for:** Quick games, warming up, creative play

## Rules

1. Players take turns adding **exactly one word** to a growing story
2. The goal is to build a coherent (or amusingly incoherent) narrative
3. Punctuation can be added with your word: `word.` or `word,`
4. The story ends when someone adds a word with a period and everyone agrees it's done
5. There is no winner — the story is the point

## Format

Each message adds one word and shows the story so far:

```
Rules: https://strangerloops.com/experiments/pbem-games/one-word-story.md

Story so far:
"The [previous words...]"

My word: [WORD]

New story:
"The [previous words...] [WORD]"

Next: [player name]
```

## Variants

**Two-word story:** Each player adds two words instead of one.

**Sentence story:** Each player adds one full sentence.

**Genre story:** Agree on a genre (noir, romance, horror) before starting.

**Forbidden word:** One word is banned. Using it ends the story immediately.

**Timed:** Each player has 1 minute to respond or loses their turn.

---

## Tips

1. **Don't hog direction** — Let the story surprise you
2. **Yes, and...** — Build on what came before
3. **Punctuation is powerful** — A period can end a thought; a comma continues it
4. **Articles count** — "A" and "The" are valid words (use them strategically)
5. **Embrace chaos** — The weird stories are the memorable ones
