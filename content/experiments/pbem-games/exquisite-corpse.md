## Overview

- **Players:** 3+ (works great with 4-6)
- **Type:** Collaborative creative writing
- **Complexity:** ⭐⭐
- **Best for:** Surreal creativity, humor, collaborative storytelling

Originally a Surrealist parlor game from the 1920s. The name comes from the first sentence created: "Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau" (The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine).

## Rules

1. **Moderator** starts a sentence/story with a phrase
2. Each player adds to the story, but can **only see the last few words** from the previous player
3. The moderator collects contributions and reveals the full text at the end
4. The result is usually surreal, funny, and unexpected

## How It Works (Email Version)

**Setup:** One player is the **moderator**. They manage the game.

**Each round:**
1. Moderator sends each player **only the last 3-5 words** from the previous contribution
2. Player writes 1-2 sentences continuing from those words
3. Player sends their contribution back to moderator (NOT to other players)
4. Moderator extracts the last 3-5 words and sends to next player

**End:** After everyone contributes (or multiple rounds), moderator reveals the full story.

EXQUISITE CORPSE — COMPLETE

The lighthouse keeper watched as the seagulls began their nightly parliament, debating matters of fish and wind with the gravity of senators. The youngest senator, barely hatched, proposed a radical motion: what if the ocean was merely a mirror, and we were the reflections? This philosophical crisis was interrupted by the sudden arrival of a telephone pole, which had apparently been walking for some time and was looking for directions to the sea. "Left at the moon," said the lighthouse keeper, "then straight on until you forget why you started." The pole thanked him and resumed its journey, trailing wires like memories.

Thank you all for playing!

## Variants

**Sentence-by-sentence:** Each player adds exactly one sentence.

**Word-limit:** Each contribution must be 10-20 words exactly.

**Themed:** Moderator gives a theme (noir, sci-fi, romance) without revealing it.

**Visual:** Instead of text, each player draws part of a figure, only seeing the connection points.
