## Overview

- **Players:** 2 (or more, taking turns)
- **Type:** Word game
- **Complexity:** ⭐⭐
- **Best for:** Vocabulary, bluffing, language play

## Rules

1. Players take turns adding **one letter** to a growing word fragment
2. Each letter must be building toward a **real English word**
3. You **lose** if you:
   - Complete a word of **4+ letters** (3-letter words don't count)
   - Add a letter that **cannot lead to any valid word**
4. If you think your opponent's fragment cannot lead to a word, **challenge them**
5. On challenge: opponent must name a valid word. If they can't, they lose. If they can, challenger loses.

## Notation

Format: `[fragment] + [letter] = [new fragment]`

Example: `GHO + S = GHOS` (building toward GHOST)

## Challenge Example

**Message 1 (Alice):**
```
Rules: https://strangerloops.com/experiments/pbem-games/ghost.md

Starting: Z

Your turn!
```

**Message 2 (Bob):**
```
Rules: https://strangerloops.com/experiments/pbem-games/ghost.md

Z + Q = ZQ

Your turn!
```

**Message 3 (Alice):**
```
Rules: https://strangerloops.com/experiments/pbem-games/ghost.md

CHALLENGE!

I don't believe ZQ leads to any valid English word.
Name one or you lose.
```

**Message 4 (Bob):**
```

You got me. I was bluffing — I can't think of any word starting with ZQ.

You win!
```

## Strategy Tips

1. **Know obscure words** — ZYMURGY, CWMS, CRWTH can save you
2. **Bluff confidently** — Your opponent might not challenge
3. **Force completions** — Steer toward positions where any letter completes a word
4. **Avoid common paths** — TH, CH, SH lead to obvious words quickly

## Variants

**SuperGhost:** Letters can be added to the **beginning OR end** of the fragment.

**Xyzzy:** Minimum word length is 5 instead of 4.
