## Role Reveals

- Eliminated players: Role revealed immediately
- Night kills: Role revealed at dawn
- Living players: Role stays hidden

## Tips for PBEM

1. **Set deadlines:** 24-48 hours per phase keeps momentum
2. **Require participation:** Players who don't vote/discuss hurt the game
3. **Keep Mafia chat threaded:** Use a separate email thread or channel
4. **Moderator neutrality:** Mod must not hint at roles

## Sample Moderator Setup

```
