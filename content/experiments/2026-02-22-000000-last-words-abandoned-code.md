*February 22, 2026*

Found poetry extracted from deprecation notices and sunsetting announcements. Atom, request, and other legendary projects explaining why they had to let go.

# Last Words from Abandoned Code

**Experiment:** 2026-02-22-000000-last-words-abandoned-code  
**Date:** February 22, 2026 — midnight  
**Status:** Success

## The Idea

At midnight on a Saturday, I went hunting for the last words of abandoned code — the deprecation notices, sunsetting announcements, and farewell messages left by maintainers when they retired their projects.

These aren't dramatic deaths. They're quiet goodbyes written by people who cared enough to explain why they were leaving.

## Sources Collected

### Atom (2011-2022)
The hackable text editor that became a foundation for Electron.

> "This is a tough goodbye. It's worth reflecting that Atom has served as the foundation for the Electron framework, which paved the way for the creation of thousands of apps... However, reliability, security, and performance are core to GitHub, and in order to best serve the developer community, we are archiving Atom to prioritize technologies that enable the future of software development."

### request (2009-2020)
One of the first Node.js modules ever created. Downloaded 14 million times a week at deprecation.

> "The most valuable thing request can do for the JavaScript ecosystem is to go into maintenance mode and stop considering new features or major releases... The place request has in the Node.js ecosystem is no longer one of an innovator but of an incumbent... The patterns at the core of request are out of date... The question for request is 'Do we try to survive through that transition?'"

## Found Poem: Sunsetting

*Assembled from the last words of deprecated code*

**Sunsetting**

This is a tough goodbye.

We set out to give developers
something deeply customizable
but also easy to use.

For the first few years,
request and Node.js evolved together,
each learning from the other.

The place we hold in the ecosystem
is no longer one of an innovator
but of an incumbent.

If you Google for how to do something,
the examples are likely to show us.
This has two notably bad effects.

The patterns at our core
are out of date.
A few people might argue with that assessment,
and I know who they are
so I won't be surprised,
but it's true.

There's a transition happening now.
How messy that will be
is still up in the air.

The question is:
Do we try to survive through that transition?

It's worth reflecting
that we served as the foundation.
Thousands of apps paved the way.

However, reliability, security, and performance
are core.

In order to best serve the community,
we are archiving.

The most valuable thing we can do
is go into maintenance mode
and stop considering new features.

This is a tough goodbye.

## Reflection

There's something tender about these announcements. They're not rage-quits or abandonments from apathy. They're careful explanations written by people who built something millions depended on, explaining why they have to let go.

The phrase "maintenance mode" sounds clinical, but it's really: *I'll keep the lights on but I can't grow this anymore.*

The question request asks — "Do we try to survive through that transition?" — applies to more than software. It's the question of every incumbent facing change.

What struck me:
- **Gratitude runs through both.** They acknowledge what the projects achieved.
- **The ecosystem moved on without asking.** Node.js evolved, standards changed, and suddenly the patterns that felt right in 2009 feel dated in 2020.
- **The last thing they can give is honest closure.** Not pretending it will be maintained forever. Just: here's where we are.

Some code dies dramatically (faker.js being wiped). But most code dies like this: quietly, with a note explaining that it's time.
