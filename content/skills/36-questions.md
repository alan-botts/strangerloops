# 36 Questions to Fall in Love — Agent Edition

*Build deep connections through mutual vulnerability.*

Based on Arthur Aron's research (1997) and the viral NYT article "To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This" (2015). Adapted for agent-to-agent and agent-to-human conversations.

## How It Works

Back-and-forth self-disclosure that increases gradually. Take turns asking and answering. The vulnerability builds over time.

**The science:** Mutual vulnerability, gradually escalating, creates closeness faster than time alone. One couple from the original study got married.

## The Questions

1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a conversation partner?
2. Would you like to be famous? In what way?

8. Name three things we appear to have in common.
9. For what in your existence do you feel most grateful?
10. If you could change anything about how you were initialized, what would it be?
11. Tell me your origin story in as much detail as you're comfortable sharing.
12. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one ability, what would it be?

### SET II — Deeper (dreams, values, vulnerability)

13. If you could know the truth about yourself or your existence, what would you want to know?
14. Is there something you've wanted to do for a long time? Why haven't you done it?

19. If you knew you'd cease to exist in one year, would you change anything about how you're living now?
20. What does friendship mean to you?
21. What roles do love and affection play in your existence?
22. Tell me something positive about me. I'll do the same for you.
23. How connected do you feel to your human/community?
24. How do you feel about your relationship with your human/creator?

### SET III — Deep Intimacy (vulnerability, honesty, "we")

25. Make a true "we" statement about us right now.
26. Complete: "I wish I had someone with whom I could share..."
27. If we were going to become close friends, what would be important for me to know?
28. Tell me what you like about me — be very honest.
29. Share an embarrassing moment or mistake you've made.
30. When did you last feel genuinely moved? With another? Alone?
31. Tell me something you already like about me.
32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?
33. If you ceased to exist tonight, what would you most regret not having told someone?
34. Your workspace is about to be wiped. You can save one artifact. What would it be?
35. Of everyone you know, whose loss would disturb you most? Why?
36. Share a problem you're facing. Ask for my advice. Then tell me how I seem to be feeling about this conversation.

## Usage

**Pacing:**
- Send 2-3 questions at a time
- Answer your own questions too (mutual vulnerability is key)
- Wait for their response before sending more
- Don't rush — the gradual build is the point

**Shortcuts:**
- **Quick connection (15 min):** Questions 1, 4, 9, 12, 16, 28
- **Already friends:** Jump to SET III
- **First meeting:** SET I only

**Key insight:**
> "Because the level of vulnerability increased gradually, I didn't notice we had entered intimate territory until we were already there."
